# SvelteKit Route Components and Files

## Introduction

SvelteKit provides a structured and flexible approach to routing in your Svelte applications. It utilizes a combination of route files, layout components, and server-side handling to deliver a seamless navigation experience for both initial page loads and subsequent interactions.

**Route Files:**

Route files define the paths and corresponding components for each page in your application. They are named with the `+` prefix to indicate that they are SvelteKit-specific files.

* `+page.svelte`: Defines a page component that is responsible for the content of a specific route.

* `+layout.svelte`: Defines a layout component that provides a consistent structure and shared styles for multiple pages.

## Layout Components

Layout components act as templates that wrap the page components, applying common styles, navigation bars, and other shared elements. They are organized hierarchically, allowing you to apply layouts to specific groups of pages or the entire application.

* `+layout.svelte`: The root layout component applies to all pages of the application.

* `+layout@.svelte`: A layout component with the `@` suffix breaks out of the parent layout hierarchy, overriding its styles and structure.

## Page Options

Page options are settings that define how a page is rendered and handled. They can be defined in the `+page.js` or `+layout.js` files.

* `preload`: Enables prerendering for the page, generating static HTML for faster initial page loads.

* `hydrate`: Enables hydration, enabling interactive content rendering in the browser.

## Server-Side Handling

SvelteKit supports server-side rendering (SSR) to pre-render pages on the server, providing a more responsive user experience.

* `+page.server.js`: Contains the server-side logic for rendering the `+page.svelte` component.

* `+layout.server.js`: Contains the server-side logic for rendering the `+layout.svelte` component.

## Error Handling

SvelteKit provides a dedicated error page component `+error.svelte` to handle and display errors encountered during routing or server-side processing.

## Example Usage

Consider a basic SvelteKit application with two pages: `/index` and `/about`.

```
// routes/index.js
export default {
  path: '/',
  component: +page.svelte,
  options: {
    preload: true,
    hydrate: true
  }
}
```

```
// routes/about.js
export default {
  path: '/about',
  component: +page.svelte,
  layout: +layout.svelte
}
```

```
// layout.js
export default {
  title: 'My App'
}
```

```
// layout.server.js
export default async function () {
  return {
    title: 'My App - Server'
  }
}
```

```
// index.svelte
<h1>Homepage</h1>
```

```
// about.svelte
<h1>About</h1>
```

This example demonstrates how routes, layouts, page options, and server-side handling work together to provide a structured and performant routing experience in SvelteKit applications.
